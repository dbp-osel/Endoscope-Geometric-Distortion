# Endoscope-Geometric-Distortion

As one of the several important optical performance characteristics, endoscope geometric distortion can negatively affect size estimation and feature identification related diagnosis. Therefore, a quantitative and simple method to evaluate endoscope geometric is imperative for both the endoscopic industry and medical device regulatory agents. Current methods to evaluate endoscope geometric distortion are either too difficult to understand or too simple to accurately describe complex geometric distortion. 
This tool is a method to evaluate endoscope geometric distortion. The method overcomes the aforementioned limitations, has clear physical meaning, and can facilitate lesion size estimation during diagnosis. Most importantly, the method can facilitate endoscopic technology to market and potentially be adopted in an international endoscope standard. 
Principle of the tool can be found in peer-reviewed publication (https://doi.org/10.1117/1.JBO.21.5.056003). The codes package for this method can be found at GitHub (https://github.com/dbp-osel/Endoscope-Geometric-Distortion.git).

About the Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools  
The enclosed tool is part of the Catalog of Regulatory Science Tools, which provides a peer- reviewed resource for stakeholders to use where standards and qualified Medical Device Development Tools (MDDTs) do not yet exist. These tools do not replace FDA-recognized standards or MDDTs. This catalog collates a variety of regulatory science tools that the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health's (CDRH) Office of Science and Engineering Labs (OSEL) developed. These tools use the most innovative science to support medical device development and patient access to safe and effective medical devices. If you are considering using a tool from this catalog in your marketing submissions, note that these tools have not been qualified as Medical Device Development Tools and the FDA has not evaluated the suitability of these tools within any specific context of use. You may request feedback or meetings for medical device submissions as part of the Q-Submission Program.
